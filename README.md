# Vinted Clone with React

First full-stack project based on the Vinted website.
The goal was to clone it and make good use of a personnal API.

It uses all the features we've learned so far, and more.

My backend part is here : https://github.com/Julien-Allard/Vinted-Le-Reacteur
But for the front-end part I used another more complete API from Le Reacteur (with far more items on the database).
