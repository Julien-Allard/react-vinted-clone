First full-stack project based on the Vinted website.
The goal was to clone it and make good use of a personnal API.

## Features :

- checks all offers avaiable on my database and iterates on it with a nice presentation
- you can search through offers with the searchbar and the price-asc/price-desc filter
- clicking on an item allows you to see its details and buy it
- you can buy any item, payment is made with Stripe
- ability to create an account, password is safely stored with hash and encoding
- ability to create a new offer if you're connected, cookies management for your account to connect/disconnect
- more to come with account/offers management
